    "# Disaster tweets comp: introduction to NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to classify tweets potentially related to catastrophes into real or misleading tweets. It may also serve as an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP), since it covers several data cleaning techniques and classification algorithms in order to conclude which combinations are the most succesfull.The spirit of this notebook is not to obtain a top LB score, but to learn how to deal with text data, decide which techniques are more suited for this project and why others are not recommended from a beginner perspective. \n",

At some level, the idea is to **replicate the idea of a memory**, since previous segments of data may affect the following ones, hence helping the model to recognise patterns in the sentence.
